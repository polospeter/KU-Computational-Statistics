# KU-Computational-Statistics
This repository includes my assignments for the Computational Statistics course at KU.

The course covered the following topics:

- Maximum-likelihood and numerical optimization
- The EM-algorithm.
- Stochastic optimization algorithms.
- Simulation algorithms and Monte Carlo methods.
- Nonparametric density estimation.
- Bivariate smoothing.
- Numerical linear algebra in statistics. Sparse and structured matrices.
- Practical implementation of statistical computations and algorithms.
- R/C++ and RStudio statistical software development.
